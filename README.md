Food Blog - Ghirda Melania - 2 months

This is a project representing a food blog/personal website. 
Please download and unzip the "dir1" directory, then access the home page, "index.html" file, in your browser.

For the development of the project, I have used HTML and CSS, with elements of Javascript (Bootstrap).
The website incorporates 4 linked web pages: "Home Page", "Recipes Page", "Nutritional Information Page", and "Contact Page". The user can navigate through the website with specific buttons from a menu, placed on the top of every page, and also with the "Next" and "Contact Us" ones.
