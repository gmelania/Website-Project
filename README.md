# Website Project
### Project Overview
This project is a website that serves as a personal food blog. The website is developed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript (Bootstrap) elements, incorporating 4 linked web pages: "Home Page", "Recipes Page", "Nutritional Information Page", and "Contact Page". The user can navigate through them using specific buttons from the menu placed on the top of every page, as well as other ones. The pages contain links and buttons themselves, for example, the "Recipes Page" has buttons leading directly to 5 single recipe pages also linked between them.
### Getting Started
1. Download and unzip the "dir1" directory.
2. Access the home page, by opening the "index.html" file in your browser.
3. Navigate through the pages using the menu and the buttons.
