# Website-Project

### Project Overview

* This project represents a website that serves as a personal food blog. The website is developed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript (Bootstrap) elements, incorporating 4 linked web pages: "Home Page", "Recipes Page", "Nutritional Information Page", and "Contact Page".
