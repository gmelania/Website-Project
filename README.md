# Website-Project
Website - Ghirda Melania

This project is a website that serves as a personal food blog.
For the project's development, I have used HTML, CSS, and Javascript (Bootstrap) elements. The website incorporates 4 linked web pages: "Home Page", "Recipes Page", "Nutritional Information Page", and "Contact Page". The user can navigate through them using specific buttons from the menu placed on the top of every page, as well as the "Next" and "Contact Us" ones. The "Recipes Page" also has buttons leading to 5 single recipe pages linked between them.

Please download and unzip the "dir1" directory, then access the home page, "index.html" file, in your browser.
